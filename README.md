OneFlow -Plan to Bill in One Place
1) Goal
Develop a modular Project Management system that lets a Project Manager take a
project from planning → execution → billing in one place.
● Plan: projects, tasks, people, dates.
● Execute: task board, hour logging, status, blockers.
● Bill & Track Money: link/create Sales Orders (what the customer buys), Purchase
Orders (what you buy), Customer Invoices, Vendor Bills, and Expenses—see
Revenue, Cost, Profit per project.
2) User Roles
● Project Manager: creates/edits projects, assigns people, manages tasks,
approves expenses, triggers invoices.
● Team Member: views assigned tasks, updates status, logs hours, submits
expenses.
● Sales / Finance: creates/links SO/PO/Customer Invoices/Vendor Bills/Expenses
in Project → Settings.
● Admin: everything.
3) Use Case Scenarios
3.1 Authentication & Access
● Common Login/Signup page.
● Role-based dashboard after login (Project Manager / Team Member / Admin).
3.2 Dashboard & Filtering
● The landing page lists all ongoing projects as cards.
● Filters: Planned, In Progress, Completed, On Hold.
● KPI widgets: Active Projects, Delayed Tasks, Hours Logged, Revenue Earned.
3.3 Navigation
● Projects: create and manage projects.
● Tasks: assign and track task execution.
● Analytics: progress, utilization, profitability.
3.4 Profile & Setup (Left Sidebar)
● My Profile: update personal info and password.
4) Core Features
4.1 Projects
● Create / Edit / Delete projects.
● Assign Project Manager, Team Members, Deadlines.
● Show progress bar and budget usage on the project.
● Links panel (top bar inside a project): quick access to Sales Orders, Purchase
Orders, Customer Invoices, Vendor Bills, Expenses — shows only items linked to
the current project.
4.2 Tasks
● Create task lists under projects.
● Assign users, due dates, priorities.
● States: New → In Progress → Blocked → Done.
● Log hours; add comments and attachments.
● Toggle My Tasks / All Tasks.
4.3 Analytics Dashboard
● KPI Cards: Total Projects, Tasks Completed, Hours Logged, Billable vs
Non-billable Hours.
● Charts: Project Progress %, Resource Utilization, Project Cost vs Revenue.
5) Settings Menu (Global Lists)
● Menu items: Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Customer Invoices, Vendor Bills,
Expenses (and Products if needed).
● Each menu shows a global list (not filtered by a project).
● Users can:
○ Search (by number, partner, amount, state, etc.)
○ Filter (date, partner, state, project)
○ Group by (project, partner, state)
○ Create new or Link to a project
● Opening a document from here shows its form, where it can be linked to a project.
Reminder: Inside a project, the Links panel shows the same document types
but already filtered to that project for quick viewing.
6) Sales / Purchase / Billing (managed inside the project)
● Project → Settings is the single place to create or link:
○ Sales Orders (SO) — what the customer buys.
○ Purchase Orders (PO) — what you buy from vendors.
○ Customer Invoices — your revenue.
○ Vendor Bills — your cost from vendors.
○ Expenses — team out-of-pocket, billable or not.
● Links panel (top bar in a project) shows these docs filtered to the current project
for quick viewing.
○ Generated invoice lines link back to the Project (and Sales Order if used).
7) Timesheets
● Task → Timesheets:
○ It refers to the working time of a particular person for a particular session or
the day .
○ Timesheets billed on working days are billed or non-billed.
○ Each timesheet is an expense on the company (negative cash flow.
○ Each employee has a per hour set by the admin.
8) Concrete, Real-World Scenarios
8.1 Fixed-price project
Your company sells a “Brand Websiteˮ to a customer for ₹1,00,000.
Flow:
● Salesperson creates a Sales Order (“Brand Website – ₹1,00,000ˮ) and links it to
the Brand Website project.
● Project Manager adds milestones: Design (₹40k), Build (₹60k); creates tasks and
assigns the team.
● When Design is Done, create a Customer Invoice for ₹40,000 from the project.
● When Build is Done, create a Customer Invoice for ₹60,000.
● Overview shows Revenue ₹1,00,000, costs so far, and Profit.
8.2 Vendor needed for part of the project
You sell the project to the customer (Sales Order) and also buy from a vendor.
Flow:
● Project Manager creates a Purchase Order to a vendor (e.g., photographer
₹12,000) and links it to the same project.
● Vendor finishes work and sends a Vendor Bill for ₹12,000 → Finance records it
against the PO + project.
● The project shows actual cost ₹12,000 alongside revenue; profit stays accurate.
8.3 Team expense during the project
A team member incurs a small cost.
Flow:
● A developer travels to the client and submits an Expense of ₹1,500 with a receipt,
linked to the project.
● Project Manager approves. If billable, add it to the next Customer Invoice;
reimburse the team member.
● Project totals update: Cost +₹1,500, profit recalculated.
Why is this Hackathon Problem Important?
● Students will learn real-world ERP workflows and business workflow.
● Understand how modules talk to each other for Eg (Projects → Sales -Purchases).
● Practice problem-solving using business logic, not just coding.
Terminologies
1. Sales Order (SO)
A document that defines what the customer buys — the agreed scope, price, and
deliverables. It links directly to a project to represent revenue.
2. Purchase Order (PO)
A document that records what the company buys from vendors to complete the project.
It represents costs incurred to deliver the project.
3. Customer Invoice
A financial document generated to bill the customer for work done or milestones
completed. It tracks income generated per project.
4. Vendor Bill
A document recording amounts payable to vendors for their goods or services. It
contributes to the projectʼs total cost.
5. Timesheet
A log of hours worked by team members on tasks. It can be billable or non-billable and
directly affects cost calculation and profitability analysis.
6. Expense
A reimbursement or cost item submitted by a team member (e.g., travel, tools) and linked
to a project. Expenses can be billable (charged to the customer) or non-billable.
7. Project Management System
A modular platform that allows planning, executing, and billing of projects within one
unified interface. It integrates project, task, timesheet, and financial workflows.
